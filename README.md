# offline_gmail(a step towards FANG-less Future)

### I have recently deleted my fallback Gmail accounts(keeping only one which will eventually go), LinkedIn(10k connections and fans), Snapchat with ~400 followers, Yahoo Email(including flickr and other services), Microsoft Outlook(including all services), Facebook(with 3k followers and 800 friends)

### After downloading cloud data I realised reading emails from downloaded `.json` data is painful. So I'm creating UI in VUEJS that will serve all my Gmail's data offline and save me from painless searching for old email, bills etc
